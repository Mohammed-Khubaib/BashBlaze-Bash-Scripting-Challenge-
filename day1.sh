    # on Day 1, i will cover the basics of bash scripting :
    # I will cover :
        # Comments
        # echo
        # varibles
        # use varibles
        # basic built-in variables

# Task 2: create a bash script that uses echo to print a message of my choice.

# Task 3: create a bash script that declares variables and assigns values to them.

# Task 4: Create a bash script that takes two variables (numbers) as input and prints their arithmetic operations using those variables.

#Addition
sum=$((num1 + num2))
#Subtraction

# $?:Represents the exit status of the last executed command.

# Task 6 : create a bash script that utilizes wildcards to list all the files with a specific extension in a directory.

# * (Asterisk):Represents any sequence of characters (including none).
ls *.txt   # Lists all files ending with .txt in the current directory

# ? (Question Mark):Represents a single character.
ls file?.txt   # Lists files like file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.

# [ ] (Square Brackets):Represents a range or a set of characters.
ls file[1-3].txt   # Lists files like file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt

# [! ] or [^ ] (Negation):Represents any character that is not in the specified range or set.
ls file[!23].txt   # Lists files excluding file2.txt and file3.txt

# { } (Curly Braces):Represents a comma-separated list of alternatives.
mv file{1,2}.txt ./test1/test2/   # Moves file1.txt and file2.txt to the destination directory

# ** (Double Asterisk):Matches directories and subdirectories recursively.
ls -R **/*.txt   # Lists all .txt files recursively in the current directory and its subdirectories
